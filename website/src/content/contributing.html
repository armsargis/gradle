<h1>Contributing to Gradle</h1>

There are many ways you can contribute to Gradle. Here are some possibilities:

<h2>Tell People About Gradle</h2>

If you like using Gradle, let people know about it. Blog about it, tell your coworkers, write a review, give a
presentation, or help port an open-source project to use it.

<h2>Give Us Feedback</h2>

Gradle is still in its early stages of development, so your feedback is really important - both positive and negative.
Tell us what you like, and don't like about Gradle. Let us know what you think could be improved. Providing feedback is
a simple, low effort way you can contribute to Gradle. You can do this by:

<ul>
    <li>Joining the <a href="lists.html">developer mailing list</a> and participating in the discussions there. Our
        design discussions happen in the open, on the developer mailing list.
    </li>
    <li>Reporting bugs or adding feature requests to <a href="http://issues.gradle.org/">JIRA</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Help With Support</h2>
<p>The Gradle community is self supporting, through the <a href="forums.html">Gradle Forums</a>. You can help answer questions and solve problems there to help other users
get more out of Gradle and maybe increase your own Gradle knowledge along the way.</p>

<h2>Improve the Documentation</h2>

<p>There are lots of things you can do with Gradle, and some of these aren't well documented. Gradle also has a large API,
all of which needs documentation. You can help enormously by writing some documentation or with editing and proofreading.</p>

<p>You can find out more about working with the documentation on <a href="http://wiki.gradle.org/display/GRADLE/How+to+build+the+documentation">this page</a>.</p>

<h2>Write Some Code</h2>

Want something added to Gradle? Need a bug fixed? Got an idea for a new feature? The best way to get things done to
Gradle, is to write some code and contribute a patch. Even better if it has test cases. You can find out how to get started on
<a href="http://wiki.gradle.org/display/GRADLE/How+to+contribute+a+patch+to+Gradle">this page</a>.
