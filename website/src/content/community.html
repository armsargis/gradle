<h1>The Gradle Community</h1>

<h2>Getting help</h2>

<p>The first place to start is with the <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>. In particular,
    the <a href="${currentRelease.userGuideHtmlUrl}">user guide</a> contains a lot of reference material.
    Also, keep in mind that Gradle build scripts are simply Groovy code that drives the Gradle API, so you might find
    the <a href="documentation.html#${currentRelease.version}">API documentation</a> useful.</p>

<p>If you don't find your answer in the documentation, you might try the <a href="forums.html">Gradle Forums</a>.</p>

<h2>Contributing to Gradle</h2>

<p>Gradle can always benefit from community contributions.</p>
