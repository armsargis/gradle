This specification covers some improvements to how reports are generated and presented to the user.

# Use cases

## Developer views a summary of all tests executed by the build

When a build runs multiple test suites, it can be difficult to determine exactly which tests were executed and which ones failed, particularly if the
build console output is not retained.

It should be possible to view a persistent summary of which tests were executed by the build and a summary of their results.

## Developer views a summary of all code quality checks executed by the build

As for test execution, it can be difficult to determine exactly which code quality checks were executed and which ones failed.

It should be possible to view a persistent summary of which code quality checks were executed by the build and a summary of their results.

## Developer views a summary of all reports generated by the build

The reports generated by a build contain useful information about the things that the build has done, or useful information about the build itself.

It should be possible to view a persistent summary of the reports that the build has generated. It should be possible for a build to declare custom
reports.

## Developer views a summary of all documentation generated by the build

It should be possible to view a persistent summary of the documentation that the build has generated. It should be possible for a build to declare
custom documentation.

## Developer views a summary of the test coverage for all tests executed by the build

As for test execution. Test results and summaries should include coverage information.

## CI build publishes the reports, documentation and summary generated by the build

The CI build is often the reference build for generating documentation and reports, and for executing tests and other code quality checks. The build
should generate these artifacts and any summaries in a way that makes it easy to use the CI server's artifact publishing mechanism to publish this
output.

# Implementation plan

The approach used here is to incrementally grow a dashboard report that summarises the reports, verifications and documentation produced by the build.
The report will start off extremely basic, and over a number of steps, more content will be added to the report. Both built-in and custom reports,
verifications and documentation will be supported.

In addition, the task graph will be changed to make the dashboard report more usable and reliable in various cases.

## Add a build dashboard report

Add a basic dashboard HTML report that links to the reports declared in the build.

### User visible changes

Add `build-dashboard` plugin that, by convention, generates a dashboard HTML report that links to all enabled reports generated by the current project
and all subprojects.

To use in a single project build:

    apply plugin: 'java'
    apply plugin: 'checkstyle'
    apply plugin: 'build-dashboard'

Running `gradle buildDashboard` will generate an HTML report that links to the test and checkstyle reports, if they exist. It will not generate those
reports.

Running `gradle check buildDashboard` will generate the test and checkstyle reports, and an HTML report that links to them.

To use in a multi-project build:

    apply plugin: 'build-dashboard'

    subprojects {
        apply plugin: 'java'
        apply plugin: 'checkstyle'
    }

Running `gradle check buildDashboard` in the root project will generate the test and checkstyle reports for all projects, and an HTML report that
links to them.

Note that running `gradle check buildDashboard` will not generate the dashboard report if any check fails. Either `--continue` or
`VerificationTask.ignoreFailures` can be used as workarounds. Later stories will make this work better.

Note that running `gradle buildDashboard check` will not do anything very useful at this stage. Later stories will make this work better.

### Implementation approach

1. Add a `GenerateBuildDashboard` task type.
    * Implements `Reporting`.
    * Takes a set of `Report` instances as input.
    * Generates an HTML report that is more or less a list of reports and a link to their output.
2. Add a `build-dashboard` plugin.
    * Adds a `buildDashboard` task of type `GenerateBuildDashboard`.
    * Configures `buildDashboard` to report on all enabled `Report` instances for all tasks of type `Reporting` in the current project and all subprojects.

## Test task implements `Reporting`

## Include summary of all verification task results in the dashboard report

Change the dashboard report so that for each report generated by a verification task, include a visual indication of whether the verification has
succeeded or failed.

### User visible changes

The report will show more information.

### Implementation approach

1. Add `VerificationFailedException`.
2. Change the contract for verification tasks, so that they must throw `VerificationFailedException` on verification failure. Any other exception is
   treated as a general failure and the outputs generated by that task are assumed to be incomplete.
3. Persist the verification exception.
4. Dashboard report includes message from verification exception.

## Include test summary in the dashboard report

Change the dashboard report so that for each report generated by a `Test` task, include summary information about how many tests where executed, passed,
failed and ignored.

### User visible changes

The report will show more information.

### Implementation approach

1. Add `VerificationSummary` interface.
2. Add `TestSummary` interface.
    * How many tests were executed.
    * How many tests failed.
    * How many tests were ignored.
3. Change contract of verification tasks, so that they must provide a serializable `VerificationSummary` result after execution.
4. Persist the verification result.
5. Dashboard report includes test summary when verification result is an instanceof `TestSummary`.

## Schedule dashboard report task to run after all reporting and verification tasks

Run any reporting and verification tasks that are to be executed by the build before running the dashboard report task, so that the dashboard
report includes results from the current build.

Run the dashboard report task even if one of the reporting or verification tasks fail, so that the dashboard report shows the up-to-date results
in the presence of failures.

### User visible changes

Running `gradle dashboardReport check` will run the reporting and verification tasks first, then the `dashboardReport` task, followed by the remaining
check tasks.

Running `gradle check dashboardReport` will generate the dashboard report on failures, provided at least one reporting or verification task has been
executed.

### Implementation approach

1. Add a "always runs after" dependency type to the task graph.
    * When "taskA always runs after taskB" and both are in the task graph, then taskA must not be executed until after taskB has been executed, and
      must execute regardless of whether taskB succeeds or fails. Execution of taskA must honour the other dependencies of taskA.
2. When `dashboardReport` task is added to the graph, add "always runs after" dependencies from `dashboardReport` to any task that generates one of its
   input reports and that is also included in the task graph.

## Automatically add dashboard report task to task graph

Running `gradle test` will also run `dashboardReport`.

## Allow a custom verification task to be implemented

## Allow a custom reporting task to be implemented

## Add a Cobertura plugin

Cobertura plugin adds instrument task and coverage report task. The test task depends on instrument task and the coverage report "always runs after"
the test task.

## Include test coverage summary in the dashboard report

## Separate test report generation from test execution

Split a `TestReport` task out of the `Test` task. The test report task "always runs after" the test task.
