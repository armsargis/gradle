A paragraph about what the feature is.

# Use cases

What are the use cases we are trying to solve with this feature? That is, why should the user care? What's out of scope?

# Implementation plan

## Story 1: Some thing

An introduction to the story.

### User visible changes

A spec of the API, DSL or other behaviour that will be visible to the user.

### Sad day cases

In what ways can things go wrong? What will the user see when things do go wrong?

### Test coverage

How are we going to test this feature? This section should list the scenarios we want to cover.

### Implementation approach

How do we increment from where we are to where we want to go? How do we do this in a backwards compatible way? How do we do this without regressing performance?
