This feature is really a bucket for key things we want to fix in the short-term for Dependency Management, many of which have require
(or have the potential for) a strategic solution.

As this 'feature' is a list of bug fixes, this feature spec will not follow the usual template.

    2. Publish `1.1-SNAPSHOT`. Check `latest.integration` resolves to `1.1-SNAPSHOT` and `latest.release` fails with not found.
7. Version ranges
8. Repository with multiple patterns.
9. Repository with `[type]` in pattern before `[revision]`.
10. Multiple dynamic versions match the same remote revision.

### Implementation strategy

Change ExternalResourceResolver.getDependency() to use the following algorithm:
1. Calculate an ordered list of candidate versions.
    1. For a static version selector the list contains a single candidate.
    2. For a dynamic version selector the list is the full set of versions for the module.
        * For a Maven repository, this is determined using `maven-metadata.xml` if available, falling back to a directory listing.
        * For an Ivy repository, this is determined using a directory listing.
        * Fail if directory listing is not available.
2. For each candidate version:
    1. If the version matcher does not accept the module version, continue.
    2. Fetch the module version meta-data, as described below. If not found, continue.
    3. If the version matcher requires the module meta-data and it does not accept the meta-data, continue.
    4. Use the module version.
3. Return not found.

To fetch the meta-data for a module version:
1. Download the meta data descriptor resource, via the resource cache. If found, parse.
    1. Validate module version in meta-data == the expected module version.
2. Check for a jar artifact, via the resource cache. If found, use default meta-data. The meta-data must have `default` set to `true` and `status` set to `integration`.
3. Return not found.

# Inform the user about why a module is considered broken

### Description

There is currently no consistent approach to exception handling or reporting in our dependency resolution code. Sometimes failures are ignored, sometimes they are
reported as a 'not found', and sometimes they bubble up and break resolution, even when the module is available at another repository.

### Strategic solution

There are 3 goals:

* Add a couple of key firewalls in the code, where we handle failures and make a high-level decision whether to proceed (and warn), or fail the resolution
(and add some context).
* Remove all known places in our (inherited) code where we catch and ignore, catch and mark as unknown, or catch and discard the cause.
* Wrap/change each parser to add context on parse failure.

### User visible changes

There are 4 possible outcomes when resolving a module or downloading an artifact from a given repository:

* Success
* A remote resource is not found (a 404 status code for an HTTP request, or empty directory listing).
* An expected failure occurs accessing a remote resource (Connect exception, a non-200 status code, or a parse error).
* An unexpected failure occurs (all other failures).

In general, when an expected or unexpected failure occurs resolving from a repository:
1. The resolve is aborted for that repository (this means, for example, if we can't parse a .sha1 resource, then we bail).
2. If the failure is an unexpected failure, then propogate it and fail the resolve.
3. Log the details of the failure.
4. If there are no other repositories defined, then fail the resolve.
5. If there is another repository defined, proceed to the next repository.

TODO - there are some exceptions to this rule, for example:
* if we get a 401 fetching the .sha1, we should continue to the artifact
* if we get a 401 fetching an artifact, and the repository has multiple root URLs, we should continue on to the next URL.

# Correct handling of packaging and dependency type declared in poms

* GRADLE-2188: Artifact not found resolving dependencies with packaging/type "orbit"

### Description
Our engine for parsing Maven pom files is borrowed from ivy, and assumes the 'packaging' element equals the artifact type, with a few exceptions (ejb, bundle, eclipse-plugin, maven-plugin).
This is different from the way Maven does the calculation, which is:
* Type defaults to 'jar' but can be explicitly declared.
* Maven maps the type to an [extension, classifier] combination using some hardcoded rules. Unknown types are mapped to [type, ""].
* To resolve the artefact, maven looks for an artefact with the given artifactId, version, classifier and extension.

### Strategic solution

At present, our model of an Artifact is heavily based on ivy; for this fix we can introduce the concept of mapping between our internal model and a repository-centric
artifact model. This will be a small step toward an independent Gradle model of artifacts, which then maps to repository specific things link extension, classifier, etc.

### User visible changes

* When the dependency declaration has no 'type' specified, or a 'type' that maps to the extension 'jar'
    * Resolution of a POM module with packaging in ['', 'pom', 'jar', 'ejb', 'bundle', 'maven-plugin', 'eclipse-plugin'] will not change
    * Resolution of a POM with packaging 'foo' that maps to 'module.foo', a deprecation warning will be emitted and the artifact 'module.foo' will be used
    * Resolution of a POM with packaging 'foo' that maps to 'module.jar', the artifact 'module.jar' will be successfully found. (ie 'orbit'). An extra HTTP
      request will be required to first look for 'module.foo'.
* When the dependency declaration has a 'type' specified that maps to an extension 'ext' (other than 'jar')
    * Resolution of a POM module with packaging in ['pom', 'jar', 'ejb', 'bundle', 'maven-plugin', 'eclipse-plugin'] will emit a deprecation warning before using 'module.jar' if it exists
    * Resolution of a POM with packaging 'foo' and actual artifact 'module.foo', a deprecation warning will be emitted and the artifact 'module.foo' will be used
    * Resolution of a POM with packaging 'foo' and actual artifact 'module.ext', the artifact 'module.ext' will be successfully found. An extra HTTP
      request will be required to first look for 'module.foo'.

### Integration test coverage

* Coverage for resolving pom dependencies referenced in various ways:
    * Need modules published in maven repositories with packaging = ['', 'pom', 'jar', 'war', 'eclipse-plugin', 'custom']
    * Test resolution of artifacts in these modules via
        1. Direct dependency in a Gradle project
        2. Transitive dependency in a maven module (pom) which is itself a dependency of a Gradle project
        3. Transitive dependency in an ivy module (ivy.xml) which is itself a dependency of a Gradle project
    * For 1. and 2., need dependency declaration with and without type attribute specified
    * Must verify that deprecation warning is logged appropriately
* Sad-day coverage for the case where neither packaging nor type can successfully locate the maven artifact. Error message should report 'type'-based location.

### Implementation approach

* Determine 2 locations for the primary artifact:
    * The 'packaging' location: apply the current logic to determine location from module packaging attribute
        * Retain current packaging->extension mapping for specific packaging types
    * The 'type' location: Use maven3 rules to map type->extension+classifier, and construct a location
* If both locations are the same, use the artifact at that location.
* If not, look for the artifact in the packaging location
    * If found, emit a deprecation warning and use that location
    * If not found, use the artifact from the type location
* In 2.0, we will remove the packaging->extension mapping and the deprecation warning

### Description

As part of the effort to include Java software in Fedora (http://fedoraproject.org) we are in the process of building and packaging Gradle.
One of the issues we have is that Fedora has a very strict requirement: any software in Fedora should be buildable with software already existing in Fedora.
In order to meet this requirement we are preparing using an ant build script to build a first version of Gradle that we can then to auto-build Gradle.

One of the issues we find with this approach is the following error:
Caused by: org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.mvnsettings.CannotLocateLocalMavenRepositoryException: java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: userSettingsFile
at org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.mvnsettings.DefaultLocalMavenRepositoryLocator.buildSettings(DefaultLocalMavenRepositoryLocator.java:75)

The Fedora project already has the Maven3 jars available for use in this build, but not the Maven2 jars that we use in the DefaultLocalMavenRepositoryLocator.

### Strategic solution

While a number of Maven2 classes leak out through the Gradle DSL and cannot be immediately replaced/removed, it is a long-term goal to remove these classes from our public
API. This would allow us to upgrade to use Maven3 classes for various maven/gradle integration points (POM parsing, handling maven-metadata.xml, ...): Maven2 classes are
very often unsuitable for this purpose.

In order to start using Maven3 classes without removing Maven2 from our API, we can try to use JarJar to provide the Maven3 classes under a different namespace. This
would allow us to migrate internally to Maven3; with a goal of deprecating and removing Maven2 for Gradle 2.0.

### User visible changes

No intentional user visible change.

### Integration test coverage

We currently have inadequate coverage for mavenLocal repositories, which depend on the LocalMavenRepositoryLocator that is being converted.

The following 'resolve from mavenLocal' happy-day tests would be useful:
* no settings.xml is defined
* repo location defined in ~/.m2/settings.xml
* repo location defined in settings.xml in M2_HOME/conf
* repo location defined in ~/.m2/settings.xml and in M2_HOME (settings file precedence) 
And sad-day tests for 'resolve from mavenLocal':
* repo directory does not exist
* settings.xml file is invalid

And a test that regular resolve succeeds from http repository when settings.xml is invalid. The local artifact reuse stuff tries to find candidates in mavenLocal.

### Implementation approach

* Implement all of the integration tests
* Implement m2 repository location with Maven3
* Use jarjar to repackage the required maven3 classes and include them in the Gradle distro.

# Allow resolution of java-source and javadoc types from maven repositories (and other types: tests, ejb-client)

* GRADLE-201: Enable support for retrieving source artifacts of a module
* GRADLE-1444: Sources are not downloaded when dependency is using a classifier
* GRADLE-2320: Support for multiple artifacts with source jars in Eclipse plugin

### Description

Maven plugins publish various artifact 'types' using well-known naming schemes.

* The maven-source-plugin packages sources for a project into ${name}-sources.jar, and test sources into ${name}-test-sources.jar.
* The maven-javadoc-plugin packages javadoc for a project into ${name}-javadoc.jar and test code into ${name}-test-javadoc.jar.
* The maven-ejb-plugin packages the client jar into ${name}-client.jar. This plugin allows dependencies with type='ejb' to reference the standard jar file,
and dependencies with type='ejb-client' to reference the client jar.
* The maven-jar plugin creates ${name}-tests.jar when run with the jar:test-jar plugin. This guide: http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-attached-tests.html states that the
recommended way to reference the test jar as a dependency is by using type='test-jar'. Using classifier='tests' may also work, but has issues with some other plugins.

An example of a module containing a bunch of permutations is http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/codehaus/httpcache4j/httpcache4j-core/2.2/

Currently, the only way to resolve 'source' or 'javadoc' artifacts for a module is by using well-known classifiers ('sources' & 'javadoc'). This means that you need
to explicitly model these as dependency artifacts, or programmatically add these artifacts (with classifiers) to a detached configuration (see IdeDependenciesExtractor).

Currently, the only way to resolve 'tests' or 'ejb-client' artifacts for a module is by using well-known classifiers.

### Strategic solution

This would be a good opportunity to introduce some stronger typing to our dependency model, and to map to/from the maven model for these artifact/dependency types.
The proposed model for dependencies is outlined in ./dependency-model.md. A good start would be to explicitly map 'source' and 'javadoc' artifact types to/from the
maven repository model when resolving.

### User visible changes
An attempt to resolve a dependency of type 'source' with no classifier would map to the ${name}-sources.${ext} in the maven repository.
If a classifier other than 'sources' was on the artifact, then we would try to locate the artifact at ${name}-${classifier}-sources.${ext}.
For backward compatibility, we will continue to honour the current model of locating an artifact of type 'source' with classifier!='sources' via the
${name}-${classifier}.${ext} pattern, but we should emit a deprecation warning for this behaviour.
\
When we reach 2.0, we could:
i) remove the support for 'source' artifacts with a pattern other than ${name}-${classifier}-sources.${ext}
ii) stop adding the 'sources' classifier to the Gradle model of artifacts with type='source'.

We can apply similar changes for artifacts of type 'javadoc', 'test-jar' and 'ejb-client' for maven repositories

### Integration test coverage

* Coverage for resolving typed dependencies on maven modules referenced in various ways:
    * Need module published in maven repository with various 'classifier' artifacts:  ['source', 'javadoc', 'client', 'test-jar']
    * Test resolution of artifacts in these modules via
        1. Direct dependency in a Gradle project with relevant type specified
        2. Transitive dependency in a maven module (pom) which is itself a dependency of a Gradle project
        3. Transitive dependency in an ivy module (ivy.xml) which is itself a dependency of a Gradle project
* Coverage for maven module published with "${name}-src.jar" pattern: this will require use of classifiers to resolve, and should emit deprecation warning.
* Sad-day coverage for the case where neither type nor classifier can successfully locate the maven artifact. Error message should report 'type'-based location as expected.

### Implementation approach

This will mean that we will be checking 2 locations for such an
artifact: ${name}-${classifier}.${ext} and ${name}-${classifier}-sources.${ext}. An example where the former is required would be classifier='src', for the latter
classifier='jdk15' (where jdk15 has a different source jar).

* For an artifact of type "source", construct 2 possible locations for the artifact:
    1. The 'classifier' location: ${name}-${classifier}.${ext}
    2. The 'type' location: ${name}-sources.${ext}
* If both locations are the same, use the artifact at that location.
* If not, look for the artifact in the 'classifier' location
    * If found, emit a deprecation warning and use that location
    * If not found, use the artifact from the 'type' location
* In 2.0, we will remove the use of the classifier location for 'source' artifacts, and the deprecation warning

Similarly:
* The above changes apply to type="javadoc", classifier="javadoc" and type pattern = "${name}-javadoc.${ext}"
* The above changes apply to type="test-jar", classifier="tests" and type pattern = "${name}-tests.${ext}"
* The above changes apply to type="ejb-client", classifier="client" and type pattern = "${name}-client.${ext}"

It would be good to try to use Maven3 classes to assist with the mapping of [type]->URL and [type,classifier]->URL if possible.

Until we map these types into the ivy repository model as well:
* The IDEDependenciesExtractor will need to continue using type+classifier
* We cannot deprecate the use of classifier='sources'

# Expiring of changing module artifacts from cache is inadequate in some cases, overly aggressive in others

* GRADLE-2175: Snapshot dependencies with sources/test classifier are not considered 'changing'
* GRADLE-2364: Cannot run build with --offline after attempting build with a broken repository

### Description

When it's time to update a changing module, we expire the module descriptor and all artifact entries from the cache. The mechanism to do so it quite naive:

1. We lookup the module descriptor in the cache for the repository, and determine if it needs updating (should be expired)
2. If so, we iterate over all artifacts declared by the module descriptor and remove the cache entry for each artifact. The artifact files remain, but the repository reference is removed.
3. When resolving artifacts we do not consider if the owning module is changing or not, we assume if the artifact is available then it is up-to-date.

This leads to a couple of issues:
* Sometimes the module descriptor does not declare all of the artifacts that have been cached (eg source/javadoc artifacts). These are then not expired, and will never be updated (GRADLE-2175).
* If we fail to resolve the changing module (eg broken repository) then we have already removed the module+artifacts from the cache, so they are not available for --offline builds. (GRADLE-2364)

### Implementation approach

The goal is to never remove information from the meta-data stores, but instead to replace out-of-date information with its newer equivalent. To achieve
this, we will introduce a synthetic version for changing modules.

1. Increment the cache layout version in `DefaultCacheLockingManager`. Will need to update `LocallyAvailableResourceFinderFactory` for this change.
2. Change `ModuleDescriptorCache.CachedModuleDescriptor` to add a `descriptorHash` property.
3. Change `DefaultModuleDescriptorCache` to store the hash of the module descriptor from the `ModuleDescriptorStore` as part of the `ModuleDescriptorCacheEntry`.
4. Split CachedArtifactIndex/CachedArtifact from CachedExternalResourceIndex/CachedExternalResource to handle cached Artifacts. Let ArtifactAtRepositoryCachedExternalResourceIndex implement CachedArtifactIndex.
5. Change `CachedArtifact` to add a `descriptorHash` property.
6. Change `CachingModuleVersionRepository.resolve()` to use the owning module version's descriptorHash as the artifact's descriptorHash when storing.
   The final implementation should avoid loading the module descriptor multiple times. It should be possible to attach the module version descriptorHash,
   when resolving the module metadata, to the `Artifact that will later be passed to `resolve()`.
7. Change `CachePolicy.mustRefreshArtifact()` to expire a cached artifact if its descriptorHash != its owning module version's descriptorHash, except
   when offline.
8. Change `CachingModuleVersionRepository.lookupModuleInCache()` so that it no longer calls `expireArtifactsForChangingModule()`.
9. Change `BuildableModuleVersionDescriptor.resolved()` so that an optional "module source" can be provided. Add a corresponding property. All callers
   will use `null` for now.
10. Change `CacheModuleVersionRepository` to use a "module source" that contains the information that it will later need to resolve the artifacts of
    the module - the module descriptor and whether the module is changing or not.
11. Change `ModuleVersionRepository.resolve()` to accept an additional "module source" parameter. Change all callers to use `null`. This will mean that
    `ModuleVersionRepository` can no longer extend `ArtifactResolver` and that `UserResolverChain` will need to create an adapter.
12. Change `UserResolverChain` to call `resolve()` with the "module source" specified in the resolve result.
13. Change `CachingModuleVersionRepository.resolve()` to use the "module source" instead of loading the module descriptor.

### User-visible changes and backward-compatibility issues

* Beside the bugfixes for changing module caching, no user-visible change to cache behaviour.
* New cached module format means updated cache version, requiring artifacts to be re-downloaded where no SHA1 keys are published.
* Since org.apache.ivy.ModuleDescriptor is not part of our public API (except via ivy DependencyResolver), any change to using this internally should not impact users.

### Integration test coverage

* Will download changed version of ${name}-${classifier}.${ext} of changing module referenced with classifier.
* Will download changed version of source jar of changing module referenced with type="source"
    * Verify that we will not download unchanged version of changing module
* Verify that we recover from failed resolution of module after initial successful resolution
    * Failure cases are authorization error (401), server error (500) and connection exception
    * Will re-attempt download on subsequent resolve and recover
    * Will use previously cached version if run with --offline after failure

# Download and parse `maven-metadata.xml` at most once when resolving Maven snapshot versions

* GRADLE-2585.

### Description

Currently, the `maven-metadata.xml` for a version is downloaded and parsed:

* Once when checking for a `pom.xml`
* Once when checking for a JAR, in the case where the POM is missing.
* Once for each artifact download.

This a performance issue, in particular for IDE import, when a snapshot version is resolved multiple times, and multiple artifacts are downloaded. This
is also a correctness issue, as `maven-metadata.xml` may be changed while resolving, meaning that mismatched POM and artifacts may be used.

The goal is to parse the `maven-metadata.xml` exactly once per resolve, mapping the snapshot version to a timestamp version, then use this timestamp
version internally to refer to the resolved version.

### Implementation approach

1. Change `MavenResolver` to override `getDependency()`.
2. In `MavenResolver.getDependency()`, if the requested version is a snapshot:
    1. Attempt to map the requested version to a timestamp version:
        1. Attempt to download `maven-metadata.xml`.
        2. If present, clone the dependency descriptor to add a `timestamp` extra property to the descriptor's `dependencyRevisionId`.
3. Call `super.getDependency()` and return the result.
4. Change `M2ResourcePattern.toPath()` to check for the `timestamp` extra property when building the artifact path, and substitute it into the pattern
   if present.
5. Change `MavenResolver.findIvyFileRef()` and`getArtifactRef()` so that they no longer does any special behaviour for snapshot versions.

In theory, the `timestamp` property added in `getDependency()` will travel back to `getArtifactRef()` at this point.

Some additional refactoring will be done to continue to move away from the Ivy contracts and domain objects:

6. Increment the cache layout version in `DefaultCacheLockingManager`.
7. Change `CachingModuleVersionRepository` so that when resolving the module meta-data, it takes the "module source" returned by
   its delegate repository and stores it in the cached module descriptor entry.
8. Change `CachingModuleVersionRepository` so that when resolving an artifact, it passes the "module source" to its delegate repository.
9. Change `ExternalResourceResolver` to add `getDependency()` and `resolve()` methods that match those of `ModuleVersionRepository`. Change
   `ExternalResourceResolverAdapter` to simply call these methods.
10. Change `MavenResolver.getDependency()` to return a "module source" that includes the timestamp, when known, and to use this when resolving the
    aritfacts.

### User-visible changes and backward-compatibility issues

None, except faster builds for those using snapshots.

### Integration test coverage

* Mostly removing a bunch of `expectMetaDataGet()` calls from various integration tests.
* Check `maven-metadata.xml` is downloaded no more than once per build.
