        <sample id="useBuildDashboardPlugin" dir="buildDashboard" title="Using the Build Dashboard plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-build-dashboard-plugin"/>
        </sample>
        <para>You can then generate the report by running the <literal>buildDashboard</literal> together with any tasks that
            generate reports, for example: <userinput>gradle buildDashboard check</userinput>. Because <literal>buildDashboard</literal>
            task is always set to run after all of the <literal>Reporting</literal> tasks that were added to the task graph the report
            will reference all reports generated by those tasks.</para>
